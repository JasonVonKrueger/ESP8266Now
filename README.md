# ESP8266Now
PoC IoT button for ServiceNow

This project will create an IoT button out of an ESP8266 board I had laying around. THis particular board has built-in LCD which is absolutely not needed for this project.

Like I said, it was laying around and was the first one I picked up.  You can get cheaper boards.
