# ESP8266Now
PoC IoT button for ServiceNow

This project will create an IoT button out of an ESP8266 board I had laying around. This button will trigger the creation of a new incident. Note: this particular board has built-in LCD which is absolutely not needed for this project.

Like I said, it was laying around and was the first one I picked up.  You can get cheaper boards.

I'll use https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/wifi-connected-button-esp8266-tutorial/ as a starting point.  

Actually, maybe I'll make use of the LCD to give feedback....yeah, I think I'll do that.  Make it return the incident number or whatever.
